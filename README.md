# WATstrending  AKA "trendWATCHer" #

###What is it?###


trendWATCHer is a project created by Nick Mostowich and Victor Vucicevich one night because they wanted to make something that could potentially be used by the Pebble Smartwatch.

This project has a node.js backend with an Android client written by Nick and Victor, respectively. 

When the user launches the application, they are presented with some of the top trends on Twitter. When they choose one, tweets with that trend will be sent to your watch over a defined interval. 
Later implementations will include a trend choice.
